To import the application in Android Studio just select build.gradle file.
Dependencies should be automatically solved but anyways the app uses only support libraries appcompat-v7 23.1.1 and design 23.1.1.
minSdkVersion is 14 and targetSdk is 23.
Build tools version 23.0.2.
There is no need to setup the database, some sample data will be entered automatically upon first login for testing purposes.
